"""Prometheus metrics shared by the HTTP API and the gRPC service (Part C).

Each process (studyslot-app and studyslot-grpc) has its own copy of these
metrics and serves them on its own /metrics page. Prometheus adds a `job`
label (studyslot / studyslot-grpc), so the two can be compared or summed.

Label rule: label values always come from small, fixed sets (HTTP methods,
route templates, status codes, RPC names). Never user IDs, booking IDs,
request IDs or trace IDs - those would create a new time series per request.

# so slow calls land in a real bucket instead of only in +Inf.
